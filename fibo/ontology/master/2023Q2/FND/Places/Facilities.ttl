		"The http://www.omg.org/spec/EDMC-FIBO/FND/20210101/Places/Facilities.rdf version of this ontology was modified to allow a facility to exist at some location that has an address without requiring it to be situated at some site to simplify usage in cases where the site and facility have 100 percent overlap and are not tracked independently." ,
