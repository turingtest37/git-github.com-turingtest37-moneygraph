		"""The http://www.omg.org/spec/FIBO/Foundations/20130601/Organizations/Organizations.owl version of the ontology was revised in advance of the September 2013 New Brunswick, NJ meeting, as follows:
	(1) to use slash style URI/IRIss (also called 303 URIs, vs. hash style) as required to support server side processing 
	(2) to use version-independent IRIs for all definitions internally as opposed to version-specific IRIs
	(3) to change the file suffix from .owl to .rdf to increase usability in RDF tools
	(4) to use 4-level abbreviations and corresponding namespace prefixes for all FIBO ontologies, reflecting a family/specification/module/ontology structure
	(5) to incorporate changes to the specification metadata to support documentation at the family, specification, module, and ontology level, similar to the abbreviations.""" ,

		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/FND/Organizations/Organizations.rdf version of this ontology was modified to to move basic organization sub-unit and identifier definitions to FND from BE due to their fundamental nature and reusability and add links to the W3C organization ontology to provide hints as to which classes in this ontology map to the W3C ontology.
