		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was modified to normalize the representation of security forms (all individuals rather than a mixed representation)." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was modified to use the Commons Ontology Library (Commons) rather than the OMG's Languages, Countries and Codes (LCC), eliminating redundancies in FIBO as appropriate." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to eliminate a false positive hygiene testing issue due to a concept whose name included 'and' but that actually was a singular concept." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to eliminate an extraneous subclass axiom." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to eliminate an unused ontology import, changed the range of hasLotSize to xsd:decimal, and modified the definition of listing to point to an offering rather than directly to the instrument that the offering pertains to." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to eliminate confusion between listed security and listing (which caused reasoning issues), adjust definitions to eliminate ambiguity, add a property for lot size on listing, and eliminate the now redundant and confusing registered security form class." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to eliminate duplication of concepts in LCC and to eliminate the redundancy between hasIssue and lists." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to incorporate the form of registration and loosen the restriction on the number of possible registration authorities for a registered security." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to rename isIssuedIn to isIssuedOn, which is more natural to most securities SMEs, generalized certain references to securities exchanges, and eliminate deprecated elements." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to restructure the concept of a listing and augment it with a number of relevant characteristics." ,
		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/SEC/Securities/SecuritiesListings.rdf version of this ontology was revised to reuse the composite date value datatype and add disjointness between registered security and exempt security."
