		"The https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/DerivativesContracts/CurrencyContracts/ version of this ontology was modified to reflect the addition of the concept of a rates swap and the corresponding rate-based leg to the Swaps ontology, as well as the concept of a spot forward currency swap, to facilitate mapping to the CFI standard."

Investors can hedge against foreign currency risk by purchasing a currency option put or call. For example, assume that an investor believes that the USD/EUR rate is going to increase from 0.80 to 0.90 (meaning that it will become more expensive for a European investor to buy U.S dollars). In this case, the investor would want to buy a call option on USD/EUR so that he or she could stand to gain from an increase in the exchange rate (or the USD rise)."@en ;
